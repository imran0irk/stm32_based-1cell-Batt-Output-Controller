This is a STM32-f103 based battery power output controller project. It has been compilled using Arduino IDE. the key features are -

Battery sense voltage are for 1 cell 3.7v batt
Measure the battery voltage and illustrate the voltage on the oled screen (0.0v ~ 25.0v)
Display the battery status (Battery low, Fully charged, Charging On, Output ON) and battery percentage (25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 100%)
One relay is connected to control the output. it also has a hold function to prevent continuous connect-disconnect loop!
